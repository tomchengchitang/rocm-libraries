# hipDNN CPU Reference Implementation - Operation Support

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the operations currently supported in the hipDNN CPU Reference Implementation and the details of their implementation support.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ⚠️ **The CPU Reference Implementation is for testing and validation purposes only.** This implementation provides ground-truth results for validating GPU implementations and is not optimized for performance.

## Purpose
