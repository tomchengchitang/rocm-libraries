    - relu_lower_clip set
    - relu_lower_clip and relu_upper_clip set

## Operation Notes

> [!NOTE]
> **Batchnorm Operations:** Currently, only spatial batchnorm mode is supported. Spatial mode computes statistics over the batch (N) and spatial dimensions (H, W, or D, H, W) for each channel.

> [!NOTE]
> **Convolution Operations:** Currently, only cross-correlation convolutions are supported. True mathematical convolution (with kernel flipping) is not yet implemented. In practice, cross-correlation is the standard operation used in modern deep learning frameworks.

> [!NOTE]
> **Fused Operations:** Fused graph patterns combine multiple operations:
> - **Batchnorm Inference + Activation:** Combines batchnorm inference (using invVariance) with forward activation (ReLU)
> - **Batchnorm Inference with Variance + Activation:** Combines batchnorm inference (using variance) with forward activation (ReLU)
> - **Batchnorm Inference + DReLU + Backward:** Combines batchnorm inference, activation backward (DReLU), and batchnorm backward
> - **Batchnorm Training + Activation:** Combines batchnorm training with forward activation
> - **Convolution Forward + (Bias) + Activation:** Combines convolution forward, optional bias addition, and forward activation

> [!NOTE]
> **Activation Functions:** Supports ReLU, Clipped ReLU (with configurable upper clip), and CLAMP (with configurable lower/upper clips).

> [!NOTE]
> **Sparse Support:** All operations currently work with dense tensors only.

> [!NOTE]
> **Batchnorm Training Running Statistics:** Batchnorm training supports updating running statistics using separate read and write buffers. The previous running statistics (`prev_running_mean`, `prev_running_variance`) are read-only inputs, while the next running statistics (`next_running_mean`, `next_running_variance`) are write-only outputs. The exponential moving average is computed as: `next_running = (1 - momentum) * prev_running + momentum * batch_statistic`.
