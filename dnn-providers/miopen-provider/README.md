# MIOpen Provider Plugin
A plugin wrapping MIOpen in order to provide engines to solve some hipDNN graphs.

## Building
This plugin can be built as part of the MIOpen project or as a standalone plugin.

### Building as part of hipDNN
1. Follow the build instructions for hipDNN defined in [Building hipDNN](../../projects/hipdnn/docs/Building.md).
1. Currently the plugin build is defaulted to on.  Eventually it won't be a hipdnn build option.

### Building as a standalone plugin
In order to build the plugin standalone, you will need to have installed hipDNN and MIOpen on the system first.

1. Navigate to the `dnn-providers/miopen-provider` directory.
1. Make a build directory, `mkdir build && cd build`.
1. Run `cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<path to amdclang>/clang++ ..` to configure the build.
1. Run `ninja` to build the plugin.
